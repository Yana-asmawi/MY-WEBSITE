        Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian 
        mainland, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the
        East China Sea in the south.The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, 
        covering 377,975 square kilometres (145,937 sq mi). Japan has a population of nearly 124 million as of 2024, and is the eleventh-most populous country.
        Its capital and largest city is Tokyo; the Greater Tokyo Area is the largest metropolitan area in the world, with more than 38 million inhabitants as 
        of 2016. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. About three-quarters of the country's terrain 
        is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains.
        The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making its islands prone to destructive earthquakes and tsunamis.
        The name "Japan" is based on Min or Wu Chinese pronunciations of 日本 and was introduced to European languages through early trade. 
        In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the Early Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國 as Cipangu.
        The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese 
        traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century.  The first version of the name in English 
        appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.</h4>

            Modern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese 
            Paleolithic. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to 
            Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture.
            Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The Japonic-speaking 
            Yayoi people entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, intermingling with the Jōmon; the Yayoi 
            period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy
            from China and Korea.According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in 
            central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.Japan first appears in written history 
            in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje(a Korean kingdom)
            in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, 
            Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class,including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread 
            acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).In 645, the government led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Fujiwara 
            no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on 
            Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among
            cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The 
            true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, 
            which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn 
            about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince 
            Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated 
            with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central
            and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsuryō state, a system of Chinese-style centralized 
            government that remained in place for half a millennium.
